Jmatrix [[0,10],[10,0]] # Jmatrix in python format.


# Notes
Either Jmatrix or J statments are allowed. Not both.
Spin statements can lack all the relaxation times, or have a _ instead.
If relax time not defined, it needs to use the global molecule time.
These are also optional, but if they lack, the individual spin lifetimes need to be all there.

GENERAL can alos not be there.
